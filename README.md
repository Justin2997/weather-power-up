# Simple Kamban Power-Up for Trello

### Hosting

We need a place to host our Power-Up. For the purposes of this example we
recommend [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) which has an excellent free plan.

If you fork this repository, you can point your Netlify site at your forked
version of the repository.

1. Click `New site from Git`
2. Find and select your version of this repository
3. Your "Build command" should be `yarn build`
4. Your "Publish directory" should be `dist`
5. Click `Deploy site` and your Power-Up will build and have a Netlify address

## Resources

Trello has a whole [Developers Site](https://developers.trello.com/) with
various guides and documentation.
